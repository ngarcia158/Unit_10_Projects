00:01.000-->00:004.000
We observe today

00:04.000-->00:06.000
not a victory party,

00:06.000-->00:10.000
but in celebration of freedom -

00:10.000-->00:12.000
symbolizing the end,

00:12.000-->00:15.000
as well as the beginning -

00:15.000-->00:17.000
signifying renewal,

00:17.000-->00:19.000
as well as change.

00:19.000-->00:22.000
For i have sworn before you

00:22.000-->00:24.000
and algmighty God

00:24.000-->00:27.000
the same solemn oath

00:27.000-->00:30.000
our forebears prescribed

00:30.000-->00:33.000
nealy a century and three quarters ago.
